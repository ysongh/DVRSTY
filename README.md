#DVRSTY

#This is our entry to the Environmental Hackathon July 12-13, 2019

#Our project allows specialists to identify anomalies in temperature, CO2, dew point and humidity using artificial neural network known as autoencoders.  In addition to Reactjs as our front end, our back end is python and we are using aws sagemaker (http://ec2-174-129-187-236.compute-1.amazonaws.com:3000/) and EC2 system to host.
